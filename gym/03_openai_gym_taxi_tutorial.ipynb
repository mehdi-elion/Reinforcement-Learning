    "Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that seeks to find the best possible next action given its current state, in order to maximise the reward it receives (the 'Q' in Q-learning stands for quality - i.e. how valuable an action is).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the following starting state:\n",
    "\n",
    "![taxi state](https://www.gocoder.one/static/start-state-6a115a72f07cea072c28503d3abf9819.png \"An example Taxi state\")\n",
